We introduce two different algorithms ZPDES that uses a simple graph of knowledge and RiARiT that includes a more complex student model. The details of the algorithms and the user studies are presented in the following paper: B. Clement, D. Roy, P.-Y. Oudeyer, M. Lopes, Multi-Armed Bandits for Intelligent Tutoring Systems, Journal of Educational Data Mining (JEDM), 2015 [(arXiv:1310.3174 [cs.AI])](http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3174).\n",

In this notebook, we will describe how to define one part of the files needed to describe an activity. The other files to describe the sequence managers are the parameters files described in [this notebook](../Parameters_files/Parameters_files.ipynb)."
