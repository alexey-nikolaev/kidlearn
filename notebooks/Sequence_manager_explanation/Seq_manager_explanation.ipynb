    "As presented in KidlearnStarter notebook, the Kidlearn library includes a set of algorithms that we develop to guide pedagogical activities. We introduce two different algorithms ZPDES that uses a simple graph of knowledge and RiARiT that includes a more complex student model. The details of the algorithms and the user studies are presented in the following paper: B. Clement, D. Roy, P.-Y. Oudeyer, M. Lopes, Multi-Armed Bandits for Intelligent Tutoring Systems, Journal of Educational Data Mining (JEDM), 2015 [(arXiv:1310.3174 [cs.AI])](http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3174).\n",

    "These algorithms are implemented in the ***seq_manager*** module of the library, with some others sequence managers used to evaluate our algorithms. In this notebook, we will describe how to define the activity for each algorithms and what are the parameters files used to define the the algorithms parameters. "
