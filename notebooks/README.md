# Notebooks

Here are some tutorials and explanations about the code and our work. You can look at the notebook for guided tutorial. All the notebook are also transcribed in python scripts.

To test these notebooks, you can use SageMathCloud, as described here:

Go to SageMathCloud
Sign in, or create an account (<1min)
Create a new project
Enter the project
in the Terminal command in the upper right corner, type "git clone https://github.com/flowersteam/kidlearn.git"
When the clone is finished (few seconds), enter the directory kidlearn, and then the notebooks one.
Open the notebook (click on name_file.ipynb) that you want to work. 
Note: If a module is missing (and you're notified by Jupyter), you can add it via the terminal command "pip install --user MODULE"
